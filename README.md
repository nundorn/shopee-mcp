An MCP server for **exploring Shopee** — product search and prices — from any MCP client (Claude Desktop, Claude Code, etc.). Discovery only: no seller features.

> **Login required, read-only.** Shopee blocks anonymous requests, so this **unofficial** server reads public data through your own logged-in browser session (see [Why a browser?](#why-a-browser)). It performs no seller or account actions.

## Tools

| Tool                 | What it returns                                                                                                                             |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `search_products`    | Keyword search with sorting & pagination — names, prices, sold counts, ratings, seller location, product IDs, URLs.                         |
| `get_product_detail` | One product — price & discount, brand, condition, category, rating, **review count**, **sold count**, stock, location, description.         |
| `check_login_status` | Whether the saved browser session is currently logged into Shopee — check this before the tools above instead of waiting on a slow failure. |

### Tool annotations

Per the [MCP annotations spec](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/) — all tools are read-only, with no side effects.

| Tool                 | Read-only | Idempotent | Destructive |
| -------------------- | :-------: | :--------: | :---------: |
| `search_products`    |     ✓     |     ✓      |      –      |
| `get_product_detail` |     ✓     |     ✓      |      –      |
| `check_login_status` |     ✓     |     ✓      |      –      |

## Why a browser?

Shopee does **not** expose an open API or server-rendered product HTML. Its `/api/v4/*` endpoints are guarded by an anti-fraud gate (`error 90309999`) that requires per-request signature headers (`af-ac-enc-dat`, `x-sap-sec`, …) minted by Shopee's own obfuscated SDK. Plain `fetch`, headless Chromium, and even a hand-rolled fetch from inside the page all get rejected.

So this server:

1. Drives **[CloakBrowser](https://github.com/CloakHQ/cloakbrowser)** — a Chromium with binary-level fingerprint patches — against a **persistent profile you log into once**.
2. **Navigates to the real Shopee page and intercepts the response** its own app fetches, so the request carries valid signatures.

The browser must run **headed** (Shopee detects headless); on a server use a virtual display (`xvfb`).

### From npm (recommended)

```bash
npm install -g @bintangtimurlangit/shopee-mcp   # downloads the CloakBrowser binary (~200 MB, cached)
```

This puts two commands on your PATH: **`shopee-mcp`** (the server) and **`shopee-mcp-login`** (one-time login). Or run without installing: `npx -y @bintangtimurlangit/shopee-mcp`.

### From source

```bash
git clone https://github.com/bintangtimurlangit/shopee-mcp.git
cd shopee-mcp
npm install          # also downloads the CloakBrowser binary (~200 MB, cached)
npm run build
```

### 1. Log in once

Shopee blocks anonymous requests, so you sign in one time. This saves a session to `~/.shopee-mcp/chrome-profile`.

```bash
shopee-mcp-login     # global install — or, from a source checkout:  npm run login
```

- Opens a CloakBrowser window — log in, then press Enter.
- On a desktop / WSLg, the window appears normally.
- Re-run only when the session expires.

### 2. Register with your MCP client

The server launches a **headed** browser, so it needs a display. On a headless machine, wrap it with `xvfb-run`.

Claude Desktop / Claude Code `mcpServers` entry:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "shopee": {
      "command": "xvfb-run",
      "args": ["-a", "shopee-mcp"]
    }
  }
}
```

On a machine with a real display, drop `xvfb-run`: `"command": "shopee-mcp"`, `"args": []`. From a source checkout, use `"command": "node"`, `"args": ["/absolute/path/to/shopee-mcp/build/index.js"]` (wrapped in `xvfb-run` on a headless box).

## Configuration

All optional — see `.env.example`. Copy to `.env` to override.

| Variable             | Default                        | Purpose                              |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------ | ------------------------------------ |
| `SHOPEE_DOMAIN`      | `shopee.co.id`                 | Regional Shopee domain.              |
| `SHOPEE_PROFILE_DIR` | `~/.shopee-mcp/chrome-profile` | Where the saved login lives.         |
| `SHOPEE_HEADLESS`    | `false`                        | Keep `false` — headless is detected. |
| `CACHE_TTL_MS`       | `30000`                        | In-memory cache lifetime.            |
| `DEBUG`              | `false`                        | Log startup/debug info to stderr.    |

## Development

```bash
npm run lint         # eslint
npm run format       # prettier --write (format:check to verify)
npm run typecheck
npm run test:unit    # offline unit tests (no login/display needed)
npm test             # live smoke test (needs a display; use xvfb-run on servers)
npm run dev          # tsx watch
```

## Troubleshooting

| Symptom                                       | Likely cause / fix                                                                                                      |
| --------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `🔒 Not signed in` / anonymous-request errors | No/expired session → run `npm run login`.                                                                               |
| `error 90309999` or empty results             | Shopee's anti-bot gate rejected the request. Ensure you're logged in and running **headed** (or via `xvfb-run`); retry. |
| A read returns empty for a valid product      | Shopee lazy-loads; retry, and run with `DEBUG=true` to inspect.                                                         |
| Empty or stale results right after a change   | In-memory cache — lower `CACHE_TTL_MS` or wait for the TTL to expire.                                                   |
| Headless / server has no display              | Wrap the command in `xvfb-run -a …`.                                                                                    |

## Caveats

- **Login required.** No session → tools return a friendly "run `npm run login`" prompt.
- **Anti-bot is a moving target.** The free CloakBrowser binary can go stale as Shopee updates detection; CloakBrowser Pro ships newer patches.
- Respect Shopee's Terms of Service. This is for personal market exploration, not scraping at scale.

## Disclaimer

This is an **unofficial** project. It is **not affiliated with, authorized, maintained, sponsored, or endorsed by Shopee or Sea Limited**.

It works by driving a real logged-in browser session against Shopee's web app, which can change without notice — a tool may break when Shopee updates its site or anti-bot behavior. It reads only publicly available product data and performs no account actions.

You are responsible for using this software in compliance with [Shopee's Terms of Service](https://shopee.co.id/docs/terms) and applicable law. Use reasonable request volumes. All product names, logos, and brands are property of their respective owners.

## Regional storefronts

`SHOPEE_DOMAIN` selects the storefront **and** everything that has to agree with
it — the browser locale and timezone reported to Shopee, and the currency used to
format prices and counts. Pointing the domain at Thailand while the browser still
claims `id-ID` / `Asia/Jakarta` is both wrong in the output and a signal to
Shopee's anti-bot checks, so all of it is derived from one place (`src/region.ts`).

| Domain                   | Locale | Timezone          | Currency |
| ------------------------ | ------ | ----------------- | -------- |
| `shopee.co.id` (default) | id-ID  | Asia/Jakarta      | Rp       |
| `shopee.co.th`           | th-TH  | Asia/Bangkok      | ฿        |
| `shopee.vn`              | vi-VN  | Asia/Ho_Chi_Minh  | ₫        |
| `shopee.ph`              | en-PH  | Asia/Manila       | ₱        |
| `shopee.com.my`          | ms-MY  | Asia/Kuala_Lumpur | RM       |
| `shopee.sg`              | en-SG  | Asia/Singapore    | S$       |
| `shopee.tw`              | zh-TW  | Asia/Taipei       | NT$      |
| `shopee.com.br`          | pt-BR  | America/Sao_Paulo | R$       |

An unlisted domain falls back to the Indonesian defaults; override any single
value with `SHOPEE_LOCALE`, `SHOPEE_TIMEZONE` or `SHOPEE_CURRENCY`.

**The login command reads the same variables**, so log in against the storefront
you intend to query — cookies are per-domain:

```bash
SHOPEE_DOMAIN=shopee.co.th shopee-mcp-login
```
